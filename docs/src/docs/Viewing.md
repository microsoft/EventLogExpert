Things to know about viewing, selecting, scrolling, and reading events.
## Selecting, scrolling, and reading events

* Events can be selected with a mouse click.
* Tab moves the selection to the next event.
* Shift-Tab moves the selection to the previous event.
* Arrow keys can be used to scroll the view up or down.
* Page Up/Page Down can also be used to scroll the view up or down.
* When an event is selected, the Description of that event appears in the pane at the bottom of the window.
* The arrow toggle at the very bottom right shows the XML for the event.
* The bottom pane can be resized by dragging.
* The bottom pane can be collapsed with the arrow toggle at the top right of that pane.

## Viewing multiple log files at once

* When more than one log is opened in the same window, a Combined tab appears which shows all the event logs combined, normalized ot the same time zone, and sorted by time.
* To help distinguish between events from different logs, the View menu has two options:
    * Show Log Name Column - adds a column showing the file name of the log, if it is a file, or the log name of the live log.
    * Show Computer Name column - adds a column showing the computer name stored in the event log.

## Viewing live logs

* When a live log is open, new events arriving from that log will be stored in a buffer. This is indicated by the New Events number shown in the status bar at the bottom of the window.
* From the View menu, choose Load New Events to add those new events to the view.
* Choosing Continuously Update from the View menu will cause those events to be added to the view immediately as they arrive.
