## Provider Databases

Windows event descriptions and task categories aren't stored inside an `.evtx` file. They live in resource DLLs registered against the provider name on whichever machine produced the events. Open an `.evtx` from another machine on yours, and Windows can usually only render a placeholder like `The description for Event ID … cannot be found`.

Provider databases solve that. A `.db` file contains the resolved provider metadata (descriptions, task categories, level / keyword names, parameter strings) for a set of providers, snapshotted from a machine that does have the providers installed. Load that database into EventLogExpert and `.evtx` files captured on the source machine resolve as if you were running on the source machine.

When at least one database is enabled in `Tools` → `Settings`, providers are resolved in this order:

1. For an `.evtx` opened from a folder that also contains its sibling `LocaleMetaData/*.MTA` files, those files are consulted first (this is the primary path for self-contained exports).
2. Then the enabled databases, in load order — the first database that knows the provider wins.
3. Then the local machine's installed providers as a fallback.

Disable all databases (or remove them) to fall back entirely to local providers.

### Lifecycle (Settings → Databases)

`Tools` → `Settings` → `Databases` lists every database the app knows about. The full lifecycle is covered in [Settings](Settings.md). The states a row can be in:

| Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Ready` | Loaded and used to resolve events. |
| `Upgrade required` | Schema is older than the running build but in-place upgrade is supported. The row's `Upgrade` button performs the migration in place; a backup of the original is kept on disk. |
| `Upgrade failed` | Most recent upgrade attempt failed. Use `Retry Upgrade`, re-import, or remove. |
| `Recovery required` | A previous upgrade left a backup; the original is still safe but the row needs reconciliation before going back to `Ready`. |
| `Unrecognized` | Not a database produced by this tool. |
| `Obsolete` | A v1 / v2 schema database from a long-superseded build. Not upgradable in place; recreate with `eventdbtool create`. |
| `Classification failed` | Initial classification threw. Details in `View Logs` (see [Updates and Diagnostics](Updates-And-Diagnostics.md)). |

A `Classifying databases…` banner appears during the initial pass on app startup.

## eventdbtool

Provider databases are produced and maintained by `eventdbtool`, a CLI shipped alongside EventLogExpert in the same release as `eventdbtool.zip`. The tool runs on a Windows machine that has the providers you want captured (an Exchange Server, a SQL Server, a fresh OS install — whatever produces the events you need to read elsewhere).

Root description (verbatim from `--help`):

> Tool used to create and modify databases for use with EventLogExpert

Five subcommands.

### `eventdbtool show`

```
eventdbtool show [<source>] [--filter <regex>] [--verbose]
```

> List event providers. When no source is supplied, lists providers on the local machine. When a source is supplied, it may be a .db file created with this tool, an exported .evtx file (resolved via its sibling LocaleMetaData/*.MTA files), or a folder containing either.

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source` (optional) | A `.db` file, an exported `.evtx` file, or a folder containing `.db` and/or `.evtx` files (top-level only). |
| `--filter` | `Filter for provider names matching the specified regex string.` |
| `--verbose` | `Verbose logging. May be useful for troubleshooting.` |

### `eventdbtool create`

```
eventdbtool create <file> [<source>] [--filter <regex>] [--skip-providers-in-file <source>] [--verbose]
```

> Creates a new event database.

The `<file>` argument must end in `.db` and must not already exist.

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | `File to create. Must have a .db extension.` |
| `source` (optional) | `Optional provider source: a .db file, an exported .evtx file, or a folder containing .db and/or .evtx files (top-level only). When omitted, local providers on this machine are used. When supplied, ONLY the source is used (no fallback to local providers).` |
| `--filter` | `Only providers matching specified regex string will be added to the database.` |
| `--skip-providers-in-file` | Excludes any provider name found in the supplied source. Useful for differencing — e.g., capture a fresh-OS database first, then create an Exchange-only database with `--skip-providers-in-file fresh-os.db` to omit OS providers and keep only what Exchange added. |
| `--verbose` | `Enable verbose logging. May be useful for troubleshooting.` |

### `eventdbtool merge`

```
eventdbtool merge <source> <target db> [--overwrite] [--verbose]
```

> Copies providers from a source into a target database.

The target must already exist and be at the current schema version (run `upgrade` first if not).

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | `The provider source: a .db file, an exported .evtx file, or a folder containing .db and/or .evtx files (top-level only).` |
| `target db` | `The target database.` |
| `--overwrite` | `When a provider from the source already exists in the target, overwrite the target data with the source data. The default is to skip providers that already exist.` |
| `--verbose` | `Enable verbose logging. May be useful for troubleshooting.` |

### `eventdbtool diff`

```
eventdbtool diff <first source> <second source> <new db> [--verbose]
```

> Given two provider sources (each may be a .db, an exported .evtx, or a folder containing them), produces a database containing all providers from the second source which are not in the first source.

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `first source` | `The first source to compare: a .db, an exported .evtx, or a folder containing .db and/or .evtx files (top-level only).` |
| `second source` | `The second source to compare: a .db, an exported .evtx, or a folder containing .db and/or .evtx files (top-level only).` |
| `new db` | `The new database containing only the providers in the second source which are not in the first source. Must have a .db extension.` |
| `--verbose` | `Verbose logging. May be useful for troubleshooting.` |

### `eventdbtool upgrade`

```
eventdbtool upgrade <file> [--verbose]
```

> Upgrades the database schema

No-op when the database is already at the current version. v1 / v2 databases are not upgradable in place — recreate them with `eventdbtool create`.

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | `The database file to upgrade.` |
| `--verbose` | `Verbose logging. May be useful for troubleshooting.` |
